The goal of this project is to facilitate the running of tests and code
analysis against a Moodle plugin using CI environments, such as [GitHub
Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) or [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.com).  All of these tests and tools
are run everytime a change is pushed to a GitHub branch or pull request.

History, acknowledgement and appreciation
=========================================
This repository is a fork of [moodle-plugin-ci](https://github.com/blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci), originally created
and maintained by **MoodleRooms** / **Blackboard**. All the licenses, copyrights and authorship of
the original code and commits have been kept unmodified, how not!

After some unsuccessful attempts along 2019-2020 to keep the product alive and maintained,
proposing updates and fixes via standard pull requests, asking for some alternative collaboration schemas,
and specially with the urgency of some changes to be implemented in order to keep the tool working
with modern **Moodle** versions, it was decided, by **Moodle HQ**, to create this fork and take on its maintenance officially.

Many, many thanks to all the collaborators, very specially to **Mark Nielsen** for all the hard work
making this product such a great tool for the entire **Moodle development community**, we'll try to keep the bar high!

And, of course, everybody is welcome to participate and help here, it's **Open Source**, you know!
