## [Unreleased]
No unreleased changes.

## [3.0.1] - 2020-09-04
### Changed
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] to use Postgresql 9.6 (Moodle 3.10 new requirement).
- Updated composer.json to use the latest version of `local_moodlecheck` plugin.
- Updated project dependencies

### Fixed
- `moodle-plugin-ci grunt` now also checks `*.js.map` files.

## [3.0.0] - 2020-07-23
### Changed
- ACTION REQUIRED: project organization renamed to moodlehq. You must update your `.travis.yml` to use `moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci`
- ACTION REQUIRED: If you initiated Selenium server in docker container as
  part of your test scenario (e.g. separate step in install stage similar to
  one outlined in workaround
  [blackboard-open-source/issue#110](https://github.com/blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/110)),
  this is no longer required, you can remove this step.
- ACTION REQUIRED: You may safely remove `nvm install <version>` and `nvm use
  <version>` from .travis.yml, this is now a part of installation routine.
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] with a new `services` section to ensure databases start.
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] to remove `openjdk-8-jre-headless` and updated `moodlehq/moodle-local_ci` to fix Mustache linting. See [moodle-local_ci/pull#198](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci/pull/198).
- `moodle-plugin-ci behat` is using Selenium docker container for built-in Selenium server.
- Updated version of `moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker` to v2.9.7
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] to build Moodle 3.9
- `moodle-plugin-ci install` installs Node.js (npm) using the version
  specified in .nvmrc file or `lts/carbon` if .nvmrc is missing (pre Moodle
  3.5). It is also possible to override default version by providing
  --node-version parameter or defining `NODE_VERSION` env variable. The value of
  this parameter should be compatible with `nvm install` command,
  e.g. `v8.9`, `8.9.0`, `lts/erbium`. See
  [#7](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/7)

### Added
- New help document: [CLI commands and options](CLI.md)
- Upgrade guide: [Upgrading from 2.X to 3.0](UPGRADE-3.0.md)

### Removed
- Support for PHP 5.x (7.0.0 is now required).

## [2.5.0] - 2019-02-20
### Changed
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] to install `openjdk-8-jre-headless` instead of
  `oracle-java8-installer` and `oracle-java8-set-default` packages. See
  [#83](https://github.com/blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/83) for details.
- Updated project dependencies: Moodle Code Checker v2.9.3 (added PHP 7.3 support)

### Added
- Add `moodle-plugin-ci phpdoc` check which executes
  [moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck)
  on the plugin.
- `moodle-plugin-ci behat` now provides an option `--suite` to define the
  theme to use while running the test.

## [2.4.0] - 2018-09-11
### Changed
- ACTION REQUIRED: project organization renamed to `blackboard-open-source`. You must
  update your `.travis.yml` to use `blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci`
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] to build Moodle 3.5: removed PHP 5.6 and upgrade to Postgresql 9.4.
- Updated project dependencies.

## [2.3.0] - 2018-05-14
### Changed
- Recommending `sudo: true` when using Behat. See
  [#70](https://github.com/blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/70) for details.
- Updated project dependencies.  Most notably, Moodle Code Checker v2.7.1.

### Added
- Support for MariaDB.  To use, set `DB=mariadb` in your build.  In additon, see
  [database setup](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/#MariaDB)
  documentation for how to add MariaDB to your build.

## [2.2.0] - 2017-11-03
### Changed
- ACTION REQUIRED: changed the `nvm install node` to `nvm install 8.9` and `nvm use 8.9` in
  the [.travis.dist.yml] and you must update your `.travis.yml` file to get Grunt commands
  running again.  These commands match what the Moodle project is currently using.

### Fixed
- `moodle-plugin-ci validate` now only regards required language strings as present if they are assigned to the
  `$string` array. Before, other array variables were accepted although Moodle would not recognise them.  

### Added
- `moodle-plugin-ci install` now provides an option `--no-init` to skip initialization of the Behat and PHPUnit
  test suites.  Only use this option if execution of these tests are not required.

## [2.1.1] - 2017-09-29
### Fixed
- `moodle-plugin-ci validate` now properly validates all table name prefixes in the plugin's
  `db/install.xml` file.  Before, if any table name was properly prefixed, this would pass.

## [2.1.0] - 2017-09-13
### Fixed
- ACTION REQUIRED: added `firefox: "47.0.1"` to [.travis.dist.yml] and you must add it to your
  `.travis.yml` file to get Behat running again.  This is because Travis CI changed their default
  environment from Precise to Trusy.  On Trusty, the default Firefox version is 55, which is not
  compatible with Selenium.
- Fixed `moodle-plugin-ci mustache` command when `_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable is set.
  This is now set by default in Trusty builds.

### Added
- Can now use Chrome with Behat, see [help document](Chrome.md) for details.

### Changed
- Set password via environment when connecting with Postgres.

## [2.0.1] - 2017-06-07
### Fixed
- PHPUnit code coverage whitelist for Moodle 3.3 or later.

## [2.0.0] - 2017-06-01
### Changed
- BREAKING: requires PHP 5.6 or later.
- BREAKING: requires Moodle 3.2 or later.
- `moodle-plugin-ci codechecker` command no longer processes Javascript files.  Use the new `grunt` command instead.
- `moodle-plugin-ci codechecker` now runs the PHP Compatibility coding standard.  This will now check for
  PHP compatibility issues for the **currently** running PHP version.  This makes it important to run this command
  on your lowest and highest supported PHP version.  EG: on PHP 5.6 and 7.1.
- `moodle-plugin-ci validate` command now validates tags in Behat feature files.  EG: mod_forum should have @mod
  and @mod_forum tags in each feature file. 
- The `.travis.dist.yml` now installs Version 2 of this tool.
- Updated Moodle coding standard to v2.7.0.

### Removed
- BREAKING: removed `moodle-plugin-ci csslint` command.  Replaced with `grunt` command.
- BREAKING: removed `moodle-plugin-ci jshint` command.  Replaced with `grunt` command.
- BREAKING: removed `moodle-plugin-ci shifter` command.  Replaced with `grunt` command.
- The Composer self update step from `.travis.dist.yml`.

### Added
- Defining ignore files per command, see [help document](IgnoringFiles.md) for details.
- `moodle-plugin-ci mustache` command which lints your Mustache template files.
- `moodle-plugin-ci grunt` command which runs Grunt tasks on the plugin. See [help document](TravisFileExplained.md)
  for more details about the command.
- `moodle-plugin-ci savepoints` command which checks your plugin's upgrade steps.
- `--dump` option to `behat` command to print Behat HTML failure captures.
- `--auto-rerun` option to `behat` automatically rerun failures, defaults to 2 reruns.
- The `.travis.dist.yml` now has steps to install Java 8.
- The `.travis.dist.yml` now has steps to install latest version of NodeJS and NPM.
- The `.travis.dist.yml` now has a step to cache the NPM cache.
- The `.travis.dist.yml` now has a step to install PostgreSQL 9.3.

## [1.5.7] - 2017-02-06
### Fixed
- `moodle-plugin-ci install` when installing multiple plugins that have circular dependencies.

### Changed
- The validation of the `MOODLE_BRANCH` value has been relaxed.  Can be any branch or tag.

### Added
- Can use `MOODLE_REPO` environment variable to override Moodle's git clone URL.  This is considered
  more of an advanced or debugging feature and should not need to be used often.

## [1.5.6] - 2016-10-06
### Changed
- Upgraded PHP_CodeSniffer to `2.6.2`.
- Updated Moodle coding standard with latest changes from `v2.5.4`.

## [1.5.5] - 2016-07-05

### Changed
- Updated Moodle coding standard with latest changes.

## [1.4.0] - 2016-02-12

- The `.travis.dist.yml` file not longer allows PHP7 to fail.
- The `.travis.dist.yml` file now disables XDebug to improve build times.

- `moodle-plugin-ci validate` command. Does some light validation of plugin file structure and code.
