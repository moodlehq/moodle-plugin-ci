## [Unreleased]

## [3.3.0] - 2022-06-28
### Added
- PHPUnit code coverage will now automatically fallback between `pcov` => `xdebug` => `phpdbg`, using the "best" one available in the system. Still, if needed to, any of them can be forced, given all their requirements are fulfilled, using the following new options of the 'phpunit' command: `--coverage-pcov`, `--coverage-xdebug` or `--coverage-phpdbg`.
- ACTION SUGGESTED: Ensure that the `pcov` or `xdebug` extensions are installed in your environment to get 'moodle-plugin-ci' using them automatically.

### Changed
- Switched from [local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) to [moodle-cs](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-cs) for checking the coding style. Previously, `moodle-plugin-ci` (and other tools) required `local_codechecker` (that includes both `PHP_Codesniffer` and the `moodle` standard) to verify the coding style. Now, the `moodle` standard has been moved to be a standalone repository and all the tools will be using it and installing `PHP_Codesniffer` via composer. No changes in behavior are expected.

### Fixed
- The `--version` option now works both with the `bin/moodle-plugin-ci` binary and the `moodle-plugin-ci.phar` package.

## [3.2.6] - 2022-05-10
### Added
- It is possible to specify more test execution options to the 'phpunit' command, such as `--fail-on-incomplete`, `--fail-on-risky` and `--fail-on-skipped` and `--fail-on-warning`. For more information, see [PHPUnit documentation](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io).

### Fixed
- Locally bundled [moodle-local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) now works ok with recent (Moodle 3.11 and up) branches. A recent change in those versions was causing [some problems](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-74704).

## [3.2.5] - 2022-03-31
### Changed
- ACTION SUGGESTED: Now, it's safe to 'unpin' the MariaDB version in all integrations. With MariaDB 10.6.7 and 10.7.3 already released, the existing problems are gone, so it's possible to move away from the older 10.5 version. To achieve that, just look for any use of `image: mariadb:10.5` and change it to `image: mariadb:10`. For more information, see [MDL-72131](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72131).
- Updated version of [moodle-local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) to v3.1.0. For list of changes see [changelog](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-in-version-310-20220225---fondant-chocolate), you should expect numerous `@covers` annotation warnings in particular.

### Added
- Use utf8mb4 for MySQL and MariaDB setup.
- ACTION SUGGESTED: If you are using GitHub Actions and running tests on MySQL/MariaDB, set env variables `MYSQL_CHARACTER_SET_SERVER` and `MYSQL_COLLATION_SERVER` for mysql/mariadb service per `gha.dist.yml` file.

## [3.2.4] - 2022-01-17
### Changed
- Updated version of [moodle-local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) to v3.0.6.

## [3.2.3] - 2022-01-12
### Changed
- Updated version of [moodle-local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) to v3.0.5.

### Fixed
- Avoid publishing the selenium container port, not needed for `host` networking.

## [3.2.2] - 2021-12-16
### Added
- Support for subplugins in the extra-plugins directory for install.
- Support for [`coverage.php`](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Writing_PHPUnit_tests#Check_your_coverage) files added. Previous coverage defaults only will be applied when that file is not present in the plugin.

### Changed
- Updated project dependencies to current [moodle-local_moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck) and [moodle-local_ci](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci) versions.
- Updated version of [moodle-local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) to v3.0.4.
- Both Chrome and Firefox are back to use latest Selenium 3 versions, previously pinned because of some interim problems with them.
- GitHub [no longer supports the git:// protocol](https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/). Please change any use to `https://` instead.
- Internal, various improvements to self testing.

## [3.2.1] - 2021-07-30
### Changed
- Temporary pin Selenium standalone-chrome image to 3.141.59-20210713

## [3.2.0] - 2021-07-16
### Added
- New tool-agnostic `CI_BUILD_DIR` env. variable that can be used instead of the old `TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR` one. Note that support for the later [will be removed](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/118) at some point in the future.

### Changed
- Updated [gha.dist.yml](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/blob/master/gha.dist.yml) and
  [.travis.dist.yml](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/blob/master/.travis.dist.yml)
  to use PostgreSQL 10 (Moodle 4.0 new requirement).
- ACTION REQUIRED: Existing integrations running tests with PostgreSQL now need to use version 10 or newer.
- ACTION REQUIRED: Existing integrations running tests with MariaDB must avoid using the 10.6 version and use 10.5 instead. It comes with some changes making it incompatible with Moodle default installation. To achieve that, just look for any use of `image: mariadb:10` and change it to `image: mariadb:10.5`. This is being tracked @ [MDL-72131]( https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72131) and, once fixed, it will be possible to go back to the original image.
- Updated project dependencies to current [moodle-local_moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck) and [moodle-local_ci](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci) versions.
- Updated version of [moodle-local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) to v3.0.2.
- Improved documentation and examples about how to ignore paths and files.

## [3.1.0] - 2021-05-14
### Added
- Support for PHP 8.0 jobs.
- ACTION REQUIRED: Small modifications are required to both Travis and GHA integrations,
  only if adding PHP 8 jobs. These changes include 1) Setting up the `max_input_vars=5000`
  PHP configuration setting, for all runs, and 2) Enabling the `xmlrpc-beta` extension
  if the plugin requires xmlrpc services, only for PHP 8 runs. See
  [gha.dist.yml](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/blob/master/gha.dist.yml) and
  [.travis.dist.yml](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/blob/master/.travis.dist.yml) for more information.

### Changed
- Updated various internal dependencies and tools.
- Moved [moodle-local_moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck) and
  [moodle-local_ci](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci) dependencies to use tagged references instead of commit ones.

## [3.0.8] - 2021-04-23
### Changed
- Updated project dependencies to current [moodle-local_moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck) and [moodle-local_ci](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci) versions.
- Updated version of [moodle-local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) to v3.0.1.

## [3.0.7] - 2021-02-25
### Changed
- Updated project dependencies to current [moodle-local_moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck) version.
- Switched to Composer v2.

## [3.0.6] - 2021-02-08
### Fixed
- `moodle-plugin-ci grunt` should also be using `npx grunt` internally

## [3.0.5] - 2021-02-04
### Fixed
- `nvm` availability check to make it work correctly in GHA
- ACTION REQUIRED: If you are using GitHub Actions, add `NVM_DIR` definition
  in "Initialise moodle-plugin-ci" step. Without it `nvm` can't be used for
  node version switching, see the step definition at
  [gha.dist.yml](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/blob/master/gha.dist.yml)
  and add missing `NVM_DIR` line your plugin's GHA workflow file.

### Changed
- `moodle-plugin-ci add-plugin` command now uses default banch to checkout
  instead of `master` if `--branch` param is not specified..

## [3.0.4] - 2021-01-29
### Fixed
- `moodle-plugin-ci grunt` now only runs against the `yui/src` directory when configuring the YUI task.
  This resolves an issue where an "Unable to find local grunt" message was reported when code was structured in a legacy
  format. See [#46](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/46) for more details.

### Changed
- `moodle-plugin-ci phpunit` when coverage report is included, phpdbg is called with ignore memory limits param
  to avoid memory exhausted errors.
- Updated project dependencies to current [moodle-local_moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck) and [moodle-local_ci](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci) versions.
- Updated version of [moodle-local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) to v3.0.0.
- Install grunt locally and use `npx grunt` to run it instead of installing it globally.

### Added
- Detect existence of legacy php-webdriver, and use a different Firefox image when it is in use.
- Add [manual](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/blob/master/docs/index.md) and [example](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/blob/master/docs/GHAFileExplained.md) on using GitHub Actions as CI tool.

## [3.0.3] - 2020-10-16
### Changed
- Updated version of [moodle-local_codechecker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker) to v2.9.8.
- Updated project dependencies ([moodle-local_ci](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci)).

## [3.0.2] - 2020-09-11
### Added
- Skip HTML validation in mustache templates adding a `.mustachelintignore` standard ignores file to the plugin. Useful for templates containing specific syntax not being valid HTML (Ionic..).

### Changed
- Updated project dependencies to current [moodle-local_moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck) and [moodle-local_ci](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci) versions.

## [3.0.1] - 2020-09-04

## [3.0.0] - 2020-07-23
### Changed
- ACTION REQUIRED: project organization renamed to moodlehq. You must update your `.travis.yml` to use `moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci`
- ACTION REQUIRED: If you initiated Selenium server in docker container as
  part of your test scenario (e.g. separate step in install stage similar to
  one outlined in workaround
  [blackboard-open-source/issue#110](https://github.com/blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/110)),
  this is no longer required, you can remove this step.
- ACTION REQUIRED: You may safely remove `nvm install <version>` and `nvm use
  <version>` from .travis.yml, this is now a part of installation routine.
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] with a new `services` section to ensure databases start.
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] to remove `openjdk-8-jre-headless` and updated `moodlehq/moodle-local_ci` to fix Mustache linting. See [moodle-local_ci/pull#198](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_ci/pull/198).
- `moodle-plugin-ci behat` is using Selenium docker container for built-in Selenium server.
- Updated version of `moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker` to v2.9.7
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] to build Moodle 3.9
- `moodle-plugin-ci install` installs Node.js (npm) using the version
  specified in .nvmrc file or `lts/carbon` if .nvmrc is missing (pre Moodle
  3.5). It is also possible to override default version by providing
  --node-version parameter or defining `NODE_VERSION` env variable. The value of
  this parameter should be compatible with `nvm install` command,
  e.g. `v8.9`, `8.9.0`, `lts/erbium`. See
  [#7](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/7)

### Added
- New help document: [CLI commands and options](CLI.md)
- Upgrade guide: [Upgrading from 2.X to 3.0](UPGRADE-3.0.md)

### Removed
- Support for PHP 5.x (7.0.0 is now required).

## [2.5.0] - 2019-02-20
### Changed
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] to install `openjdk-8-jre-headless` instead of
  `oracle-java8-installer` and `oracle-java8-set-default` packages. See
  [#83](https://github.com/blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/83) for details.
- Updated project dependencies: Moodle Code Checker v2.9.3 (added PHP 7.3 support)

### Added
- Add `moodle-plugin-ci phpdoc` check which executes
  [moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_moodlecheck)
  on the plugin.
- `moodle-plugin-ci behat` now provides an option `--suite` to define the
  theme to use while running the test.

## [2.4.0] - 2018-09-11
### Changed
- ACTION REQUIRED: project organization renamed to `blackboard-open-source`. You must
  update your `.travis.yml` to use `blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci`
- Updated [.travis.dist.yml] to build Moodle 3.5: removed PHP 5.6 and upgrade to Postgresql 9.4.
- Updated project dependencies.

## [2.3.0] - 2018-05-14
### Changed
- Recommending `sudo: true` when using Behat. See
  [#70](https://github.com/blackboard-open-source/moodle-plugin-ci/issues/70) for details.
- Updated project dependencies.  Most notably, Moodle Code Checker v2.7.1.

### Added
- Support for MariaDB.  To use, set `DB=mariadb` in your build.  In additon, see
  [database setup](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/#MariaDB)
  documentation for how to add MariaDB to your build.

## [2.2.0] - 2017-11-03
### Changed
- ACTION REQUIRED: changed the `nvm install node` to `nvm install 8.9` and `nvm use 8.9` in
  the [.travis.dist.yml] and you must update your `.travis.yml` file to get Grunt commands
  running again.  These commands match what the Moodle project is currently using.

### Fixed
- `moodle-plugin-ci validate` now only regards required language strings as present if they are assigned to the
  `$string` array. Before, other array variables were accepted although Moodle would not recognise them.  

### Added
- `moodle-plugin-ci install` now provides an option `--no-init` to skip initialization of the Behat and PHPUnit
  test suites.  Only use this option if execution of these tests are not required.

## [2.1.1] - 2017-09-29
### Fixed
- `moodle-plugin-ci validate` now properly validates all table name prefixes in the plugin's
  `db/install.xml` file.  Before, if any table name was properly prefixed, this would pass.

## [2.1.0] - 2017-09-13
### Fixed
- ACTION REQUIRED: added `firefox: "47.0.1"` to [.travis.dist.yml] and you must add it to your
  `.travis.yml` file to get Behat running again.  This is because Travis CI changed their default
  environment from Precise to Trusy.  On Trusty, the default Firefox version is 55, which is not
  compatible with Selenium.
- Fixed `moodle-plugin-ci mustache` command when `_JAVA_OPTIONS` environment variable is set.
  This is now set by default in Trusty builds.

### Added
- Can now use Chrome with Behat, see [help document](Chrome.md) for details.

### Changed
- Set password via environment when connecting with Postgres.

## [2.0.1] - 2017-06-07

- BREAKING: requires Moodle 3.2 or later.
- `moodle-plugin-ci codechecker` command no longer processes Javascript files.  Use the new `grunt` command instead.
- `moodle-plugin-ci codechecker` now runs the PHP Compatibility coding standard.  This will now check for
  PHP compatibility issues for the **currently** running PHP version.  This makes it important to run this command
  on your lowest and highest supported PHP version.  EG: on PHP 5.6 and 7.1.
- `moodle-plugin-ci validate` command now validates tags in Behat feature files.  EG: mod_forum should have @mod
  and @mod_forum tags in each feature file. 
- The `.travis.dist.yml` now installs Version 2 of this tool.
- Updated Moodle coding standard to v2.7.0.

### Removed
- BREAKING: removed `moodle-plugin-ci csslint` command.  Replaced with `grunt` command.

### Added
- Defining ignore files per command, see [help document](IgnoringFiles.md) for details.
- `moodle-plugin-ci mustache` command which lints your Mustache template files.
- `moodle-plugin-ci grunt` command which runs Grunt tasks on the plugin. See [help document](TravisFileExplained.md)
  for more details about the command.
- `moodle-plugin-ci savepoints` command which checks your plugin's upgrade steps.
- `--dump` option to `behat` command to print Behat HTML failure captures.
- `--auto-rerun` option to `behat` automatically rerun failures, defaults to 2 reruns.

## [1.5.7] - 2017-02-06
### Fixed
- `moodle-plugin-ci install` when installing multiple plugins that have circular dependencies.
- Stalled Travis jobs when Behat is required.

### Changed
- The validation of the `MOODLE_BRANCH` value has been relaxed.  Can be any branch or tag.

### Added
- Can use `MOODLE_REPO` environment variable to override Moodle's git clone URL.  This is considered
  more of an advanced or debugging feature and should not need to be used often.

## [1.5.6] - 2016-10-06
### Changed
- Upgraded PHP_CodeSniffer to `2.6.2`.
- Updated Moodle coding standard with latest changes from `v2.5.4`.

## [1.5.5] - 2016-07-05
