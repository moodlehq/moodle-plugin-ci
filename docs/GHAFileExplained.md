title: GitHub Actions CI workflow file explained
---

Below is the
[gha.dist.yml](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/blob/master/gha.dist.yml)
file with comments added to explain what each section is doing. For additional
information please refer to [workflow syntax reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

If you are familiar with Travis, it should be straightforward to understand
the new syntax, also you may find this [migration
manual](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/migrating-from-travis-ci-to-github-actions)
useful.

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:

  # when a job name is not provided
  test:
    # Virtual environment to use.

    # DB services you need for testing.

    # Determines build matrix. This is a list of PHP versions, databases and
    # branches to test our project against. For each combination a separate
    # build will be created. For example below 6 builds will be created in
    # total (7.3-pgsql, 7.3-mariadb, 7.4-pgsql, 7.4-mariadb, etc.). If we add
    # another branch, total number of builds will become 12.
    # If you need to use PHP 7.0 and run phpunit coverage test, make sure you are
    # using ubuntu-16.04 virtual environment in this case to have phpdbg or
    # this version in the system.
